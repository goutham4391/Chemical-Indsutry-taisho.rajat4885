<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>2020 was a year of terrible impact on individuals' lives and on business activity, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread crisis and disorder throughout the world. On behalf of everyone in the Taisho Pharmaceutical Group, I extend my most heartfelt sympathy to all those who have contracted the disease and express my deepest gratitude and respect to the medical personnel laboring on the front lines of medicine and everyone laboring tirelessly to prevent the spread of infectious disease. The Taisho Pharmaceutical Group is committed to redoubling its efforts to minimize the impact of the pandemic on its operations through thoroughgoing risk management and to enhance the sustainability of its business and society.</p>
<h2>Seeing the Bigger Picture: Changing Times</h2>
<p>I believe that three key points can be made about the times in which we are living today.</p>
<p>The first is that globalization has a bright side but also a murky side. The positive aspect is that, as people, money, goods, technology and information become global in nature, wealth is growing and spreading worldwide, increasing populations and lifespans and upholding consumer sovereignty.<br>Unfortunately, less salutary facets of globalization have become apparent as well. These include various disparities, exploitation of natural resources, greenhouse-gas emissions, and problems with political and economic systems.</p>
<p>The second point is that the distortions in wealth distribution that these positive and negative aspects have caused have given rise to a number of trends. <br>One of those trends is international cooperation. In response to the social problems the world is confronting today, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been proposed, urging all industries to change course and transform themselves from previous business models. Efforts to contribute to sustainable development, including CSR activities and ESG investment in stock markets, are driving the move toward reduced disparity and wiser use of natural resources.<br>Another trend is the realization of Society 5.0 in the wake of the fourth Industrial Revolution. Society 5.0 raises expectations for a new society in which people and things are connected using digital technology so that knowledge can be accumulated and shared, driving both economic development and resolution of social issues.
Integration that transcends conventional barriers between fields is already under way, thanks to digital transformation (DX), which is the transformation of business models through the use of data and digital technology, and open innovation across diverse domains and methods of use. As international cooperation and digital technology develop, we expect solutions to social problems to emerge and society to evolve into one that creates new economic value.</p>
<p>The third point concerns the impact these changingtimes are having on the pharmaceutical industry. I believe those effects include the following.
<ol class="list-num">
<li> Advent of an aged and long-lived society<br>
Social welfare spending, particularly on medical expenses, is rising, prompting demands for more efficient and effective use of those funds. It has become important to compartmentalize the spheres of self-reliance, cooperation and rescue and assistance by public bodies. Of these, the role of self-reliance, which in this context means self-medication, is expected to grow tremendously in importance. Moreover, as the workforce continues to shrink, the need for health maintenance will be felt ever more keenly.</li>
<li>The sovereign-consumer society<br>
Diversification of society, in the form of changes in workstyles and lifestyles, is combining with the development of communication technologies to change the way people gather information and make purchasing decisions. In turn, the retail sector is changing to respond to these diversifying consumer needs, furthering changes such as online and mail-order shopping.</li>
<li>Advances in medical technology<br>
The integration of digital technologies is powering transformative development in medical and diagnostic technologies. Those engaged in pharmaceutical research and development are increasingly obliged to rethink their methods and approaches.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Seeing the Details: Initiatives of the Taisho Pharmaceutical Group</h2>
<p>Taking a big-picture look at these current trends, we can see that we should go with the flow in a positive sense, proceeding step by step in the direction we want to take.<br>To grow and improve corporate value sustainably in a volatile management environment, the Company will continue to embrace these changes as an opportunity, confronting the variety of challenges that arise. While continuing to create new value as a leader in OTC pharmaceuticals in Japan, the Company is building a robust foundation for further growth going forward. We are building this base by welcoming new overseas entrants to the Taisho Pharmaceutical Group, such as France's UPSA and DHG in Vietnam in fiscal 2019, and promoting the globalization of our workforce. Moreover, as a key figure in the pharmaceutical and health-related industries, the Taisho Pharmaceutical Group can contribute greatly to the solution of a wide range of social problems as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By constantly exploring new paths in thought and action, each Operation Group of the Taisho Pharmaceutical Group is working every day to discover and solve a wide array of vital issues.</p>

<p>Self-Medication Operation Group: Sales channels are changing in Japan, as retail operators enlarge through M&A activities and online sales expand. In product terms, sales of health foods such as foods for specified health uses (FOSHU) and foods with function claims are growing briskly, forming a market approaching Â¥2 trillion in value.<br>
Against this background, the Taisho Pharmaceutical Group is taking action on multiple fronts. We are developing products that respond to consumers' diversifying needs and purchasing patterns. The Group is opening new sales channels and advancing development of products peripheral to OTC pharmaceuticals, such as cosmetics, beauty foods and health foods. Mainly through industry associations, we are collaborating on initiatives to promote self-medication, advocating tax exemptions for self-medication and encouraging correct use of switch OTC pharmaceuticals. In sales terms, the Group is building a sales organization that is responsive to changes in the retail sector.</p>

<p>Turning to the overseas operations of the Self- Medication Operation Group, the Group moved forward with the integration of UPSA and DHG, creating a more centralized, unified framework. By combining the Southeast Asian market and the European market in a bipolar arrangement, the Group is centralizing and unifying responsibilities such as quality control, product management and information management. This process enables the Group to open new markets by expanding its product portfolio and applying the business model it developed in Japan, including brand development and marketing expertise, thereby growing its business. In the Prescription Pharmaceutical Operation Group domain, the industry is changing its methods of research, testing and treatment, with new objectives for pharmaceutical development and advancements in medical technology. In addition, generic drugs are becoming increasingly popular as a means to decrease medical expenses while reforms continue to be made in the NHI drug price system. Under this environment, the Group is focusing on cultivating original product lines, conducting pharmaceutical R&D and introducing latestage development articles and products to supplement its pipeline. To achieve sustainable growth through the creation of new pharmaceuticals, the Group is bolstering coordination with outside research facilities and other companies and expanding its R&D capacity by acquiring advanced technologies.</p>

<h2>In Closing</h2>
<p>Future directions for the pharmaceutical industry remain uncertain. A difficult operating environment persists, while the COVID-19 pandemic is fomenting profound changes worldwide. To ensure future growth, the Group must respond proactively to these changes. The Taisho Pharmaceutical Group will build a management decision- making structure that can respond nimbly under a wide range of conditions, strive to reinforce corporate governance and achieve sustainable value creation Groupwide. Finally, I would like to express our sincere thanks to everyone and ask for your continued understanding and support.</p>
