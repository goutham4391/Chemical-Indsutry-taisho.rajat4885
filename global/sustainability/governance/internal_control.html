					<h1>Internal Control</h1>
					<h2 class="mT0">Internal Control System</h2>
					<p>The Company has developed various in-house systems and regulations that provide the basis for internal control, and is working to ensure their proper implementation by promoting Groupwide understanding and adherence. Also, the Company has established a structure to monitor whether business operations are conducted appropriately and efficiently based on laws, ordinances and various in-house systems and regulations. This structure is underpinned by the Audit Division, the Internal Affairs Division, the Legal Division, the Financial Division, and the Quality Assurance Management Section.</p>
					<p>In connection with internal control of financial reporting operations, relevant divisions periodically conduct self-assessments, and the Audit Division conducts internal audits. Continuous improvement activities are implemented based on the results of these assessments and audits. In addition, the Company has established the Internal Control Assessment Committee as an advisory body to the representative directors for the purpose of issuing reports in accordance with the internal control reporting system of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This committee evaluates the results of self-assessments and internal audits of the status of development and implementation of internal controls for financial reporting, and issues reports on the results of its evaluations to the representative directors.</p>

For greater success in achieving its full range of objectives, the Company, as a whole, will make efforts to increase its corporate value while considering its corporate social responsibilities and relationships with shareholders and other stakeholders. Based on this approach, the Company will establish a system, in line with the following, to ensure that the execution of duties by directors of the Company complies with laws, regulations and the Articles of Incorporation.</p>
